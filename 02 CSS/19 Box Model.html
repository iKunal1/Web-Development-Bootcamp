<!-- Box Model is the most important thing in web development. Box Model is defines the height and width of the html element. box model is defined by the "box-sizing" and it set to "content-box" by default.and we can change it to "border-box" to fix its height and width even if. the content of the element is exceeds to the size,but it's size doesn't change at all.  -->
