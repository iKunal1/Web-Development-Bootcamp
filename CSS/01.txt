css stands for cascading style sheets
they come in the file extention of .css
unlike .html files, we use .css

html is the backbone of your website, but it's not so good looking.
CSS let us create beautiful and modern looking websites.

CSS doesnot control the functionality of the site.
So if you want to click a button and have it do something , that will require Javascript.
You should focus on learning Javascript AFTER Learning CSS.

Lastly, CSS can be wrutten in 3 different ways:
1.inline with the style HTML attribute
2.Internal with the <style> element
3.external with .css file
we will tackle all these throughout the course.
